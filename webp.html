<h3>Pets:</h3>
</center>
<div>Dogs have been domesticated for centuries now, and sometimes you wonder how that happened.
How did your doggie evolve from a fearsome wolf to the adorable little fluffball you know and love now?
Through selective breeding, hundreds of new dog breeds were created for different purposes. While their
main purposes today are just to be cute, bloodhounds and golden retrievers are some of the several
kinds of dogs bred to hunt with or for humans. Interestingly enough, chihuahuas were bred for both
companionship and food by the ancient civilizations that lived in Mexico, where they were brought
back to Europe to become pets.</div>

<h3>Random Words:</h3>
</center>

There are so many emotions that sometimes you just can’t find a word to describe it.
But maybe you just haven’t been looking hard enough. Languages across the world have words that are
untranslatable for this very reason. In Portuguese, the word “saudade” stands for that feeling
when you miss someone you loved fiercely. "Enouement" is a word describing the bittersweet feeling
of arriving in the future and not being able to tell your past self how it turned out. Other words like these are:
<ul>
<div> <li> Vellichor - the wistfulness you feel when you’re in a second-hand bookstore.</div> </li>
<div> <li> Opia - the somehow both vulnerable and invasive intensity that you feel when looking someone dead in the eye.</div> </li>
<div><li> Ellipsism - a sadness that you’ll never be able to see how history turns out.</div> </li>
<div> <li> Kenopsia - the eerie, forlorn atmosphere of a place that is normally bustling and full of people but is now abandoned and silent.</div> </li>
<div> <li> Sonder - the realization that everyone around you has a life just as vivid and complex as yours.</div> </li>
<div> <li> Liberosis - the desire to care less about things.</div> </li>
<div> <li> Rubatosis - the unsettling awareness of your own heartbeat.</div> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Video Games:</h3>
</center>
Contrary to popular belief, the first ever video game isn’t Pong.
It’s actually a game called Computer Space released by Atari in 1971.
After that came Pong, which gained a lot of popularity in 1972.

As the evolution of video games progressed, so did its history.

<p><img src="https://nerdkingdomblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/polybius.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1" alt="Polybius"></img></p>

One such legendary video game was one called Polybius, a mysterious videogame manufactured by a European company
that suddenly appeared in Portland's suburbs. It was rumored to be a government-built
machine made to take control of people's minds. While it sounds farfetched,
there has been a supposed death linked back to this mysterious video game
of a teenager back in the 1800s. Right after the incident, it's said that men in black suits
came by and removed the video game from arcades. Now all that remains is the urban legend of Polybius and
its impact on those towns.
